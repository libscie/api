## Contributing code

### Where to start?

Our work is organized on our [GitHub Projects board](https://github.com/orgs/p2pcommons/projects/1). You can help us the most by contributing to issues in the "Backlog" column. These are issues that are already specified and considered ready to start work on.

The "PM Inbox" column and our [Roadmap](https://github.com/p2pcommons/sdk-js/wiki/Roadmap) contain issues that we are planning on working on further down the line. If you're enthusiastic about one of these features, come and discuss it with us on [Slack](https://libscie.slack.com/).

Technical improvements, bug fixes, documentation and other non-feature work is also totally welcome. Please create an issue first, but feel free to start work right away.

***Please note that we have [specs](https://github.com/p2pcommons/specs/issues) that the application must adhere to. If you believe these specs need amending, submit an issue to that repo.***

### Git guidelines

When working on an issue, self-assign and switch the `ready to start` label for `in progress`. Please always create a new branch for your work and submit a pull request that closes the issue when done. If you'd like input along the way, a draft pull request is also fine. Please invite recent contributors to review (at least one, but preferably two or more). Project maintainers will take care of releases.

The [project board](https://github.com/orgs/p2pcommons/projects/1) mostly updates itself based on labels. See also the [project board guidelines](https://github.com/orgs/p2pcommons/projects).

### Documentation

If your work adds functionality or changes the way existing functionality works, please document this in the [README.md](https://github.com/p2pcommons/sdk-js/blob/master/README.md). Always add changes to the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/p2pcommons/sdk-js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
