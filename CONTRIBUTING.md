## Contributing code

### Where to start?

Our work is organized on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/p2pcommons/sdk-js/issues). Our [Roadmap](https://github.com/p2pcommons/sdk-js/wiki/Roadmap) contains issues that we are planning on working on further down the line. If you're enthusiastic about one of these features, come and discuss it with us on [Slack](https://libscie.slack.com/) ([invite link](https://join.slack.com/t/libscie/shared_invite/zt-9l0ig1x1-Sxjun7D6056cOUQ2Ai_Bkw)).

Technical improvements, bug fixes, documentation and other non-feature work is also totally welcome.

***Please note that we have [specs](https://github.com/p2pcommons/specs/issues) that the application must adhere to. If you believe these specs need amending, submit an issue to that repo.***

### Git guidelines

When starting work on an issue, please comment to say you're working on it. Create a fork for your work and submit a pull request that closes the issue when done. If you'd like input along the way, a draft pull request is also fine. Please invite recent contributors to review (at least one, but preferably two or more). Project maintainers will take care of releases and labels, etc. Feel free to ask questions at any time.

### Documentation

If your work adds functionality or changes the way existing functionality works, please document this in the [README.md](https://github.com/p2pcommons/sdk-js/blob/master/README.md). Always add changes to the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/p2pcommons/sdk-js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

**Tip**: We are using [`chan`](https://github.com/geut/chan/tree/master/packages/chan) to easily modify and manage the changelog.

### Style guide

We are using `eslint` with the `standard` [config](https://github.com/standard/eslint-config-standard).

**Tip**: If you are using an editor like `vim` you can check out GEUT's [xd](https://github.com/geut/xd) to improve your _dx_. :v:
